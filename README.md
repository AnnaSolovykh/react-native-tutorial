# React Native Projects

This repository contains hands-on projects built while following the [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/) course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Udemy.

Each folder corresponds to a mini-project, demonstrating core concepts of React Native and Expo such as components, navigation, styling, state management, and more.
